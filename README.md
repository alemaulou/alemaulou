### Alessandro Lou
### 🇮🇹 🇨🇳 🇺🇸 🏳️‍🌈


👋 Hello there! I'm Alessandro. I am a Computer Science Educator, Recruiter, and aspiring Software Engineer.

🏡 I currently reside in the beautiful city of San Francisco. 

💻 I have been working at an EdTech startup based for the past year, overseeing the Computer Science Instructor Recruitment Pipeline, hiring hundreds of instructors, and dabbling in some curriculum development.

🌱 I have worked several different educational roles, from tutoring, TA'ing at the University of Washington, and most instructing classrooms of highschoolers for the non-profit **Girls Who Code**.

💞️ I have a deep love for coding, and miss it! I am in the process of a career change into software development. 

🚴 Outside of tech, I enjoy to run, cycle, practice yoga, lift, and climb!
