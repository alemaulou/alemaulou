<h3 align="center"> 💻🛠️ Projects (University of Washington Information School) 🏫🎓 </h4>

------
During my time at the University of Washington, I pursued a degree in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics) with a focus in software development! Informatics stood out as a fascinating blend of computer science and teamwork, which was very cool. The projects we tackled were all about collaboration, providing a great learning ground for coding in a team setup. Each project I've decided to showcase on had a worthy objective, be it supporting a bike non-profit, boosting plant health, or handling waste responsibly. I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to make a societal impact through coding and teamwork (maybe that's why I ended up in EdTech). 🙌
* [C-Bike](https://github.com/alemaulou/CascadeBicycleClubCapstone) (*University of Washington Information School Capstone Project/Internship*)<br>
As a the engineering lead the UW Informatics senior capstone project sponsored by Cascade Bicycle Club, I played a central role in developing C-Bike. Responsible for both backend and frontend, including detailed database modeling, I focused on process automation using a robust relational database through Django. This resulted in streamlined business operations, improved data integrity, and the creation of a user-friendly dashboard with an interactive map to enhance the user experience, aligning with Cascade Bicycle Clubs's automation objectives.
* [Plant Pharmacy](https://github.com/Plant-Pharmacy/Main) (*Software Development Course Final Project*)<br>
* In a collaborative effort within a software development course, our team utilized Python, Django, and JavaScript to build a user-friendly platform. Incorporating machine learning models through Tensorflow and Keras, we enabled analysis of plant images, delivering data-driven insights into plant health conditions. This dual-front approach involved backend and frontend development, facilitating swift identification of plant ailments and encouraging sustainable plant care practices for a more environmentally conscious community.
* [Trash Cache](https://github.com/oazeemi/TrashCache) (*Android Dev Course Final Project*)<br>
As part of an Android development course, I collaborated within a team, focusing on Kotlin to contribute to the development of TrashCache. My role involved aiding in API implementation and working on the Android app's frontend. TrashCache integrates ML models to assess item recyclability through image analysis. We aimed to simplify recycling choices, encourage responsible disposal, and make strides towards a more sustainable future.

<h3 align="center">📚✏️ Sample Curriculum 📊🎓</h4>

------
Throughout my extensive experience as a Computer Science Instructor, I've been dedicated to developing comprehensive technical curriculum in various roles. Although I can't share proprietary information, I'm eager to showcase a sample of my work, particularly highlighting a collection of mini-lessons I made using Google Slides and Pear Deck.

* [Linked Lists](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XpfXXrCHUQhT8n7LhkB-TPOSynedIpESBQUl4mh0mac/edit?usp=sharing) (***Target Audience:** College students*)<br>
  A mini-lesson on Linked Lists I put together, showcasing my custom illustrative graphics modeling the concept. The lesson involves engaging coding challenges and a live student interaction demo, aiming to foster active participation and a clear grasp of this foundational data structure.
* [Variables + Conditionals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZ8tLKpxPuPRRwBVwvY6whiT41QKCUtV1IswBCdR_Xg/edit#slide=id.g1034e2318fa_1_400) (***Target Audience:** Freshman in high school*)<Br> A mini-lesson I created to simplify concepts of programming languages, Python, variables, and conditional statements, demonstrated through a fun Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
