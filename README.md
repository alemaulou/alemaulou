<h3 align="center"> 💻🛠️ Relevant Projects 🏫🎓 </h4>

------
During my time at the University of Washington, I pursued a degree in [Informatics](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics) with a focus in software development! Informatics stood out as a fascinating blend of computer science and teamwork, which was very cool. Almost all projects were group projects - providing a great learning ground for coding in a team setup. Each project I've decided to showcase on had a significant mission centered around social impact and community betterment, be it supporting a bike non-profit, boosting plant health, or handling waste responsibly. I feel a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to make a societal impact through coding and teamwork (maybe that's why I ended up in EdTech). 🙌
* [C-Bike](https://github.com/alemaulou/CascadeBicycleClubCapstone) (*University of Washington Information School Capstone Project, sponsored by [Cascade Bicycle Club](https://cascade.org/)*)<br>
<br>**Tech stack:** Python, Django, SQL, AWS, Postman
As the engineering lead for my UW Informatics senior capstone project sponsored by Cascade Bicycle Club, I played a central role in developing C-Bike's admin dashboard. Responsible for both backend and frontend, including detailed database modeling, I focused on process automation using a relational database through Django. This resulted in streamlined business operations, improved data integrity, and the creation of a user-friendly dashboard with an interactive map to enhance the user experience, aligning with Cascade Bicycle Clubs's automation objectives.
* [Plant Pharmacy](https://github.com/Plant-Pharmacy/Main) (*Software Development Course Final Project*)<br>
<br>**Tech stack:** Python, Django, Tensorflow, Keras
In a collaborative software development course, I worked on integrating machine learning models using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. My role involved connecting the ML models, deploying the app, and leading frontend development. Our platform analyzes plant images to provide actionable insights on plant health, promoting sustainable plant care practices for an environmentally conscious community.
* [Trash Cache](https://github.com/oazeemi/TrashCache) (*Android Dev Course Final Project*)<br>
<br>**Tech stack:** Kotlin
As part of an Android development course, I collaborated within a team, focusing on Kotlin to contribute to the development of Trash Cache. My role involved aiding in API implementation and working on the Android app's frontend. Trash Cache integrates ML models to assess item recyclability through image analysis. We aimed to simplify recycling choices, encourage responsible disposal, and make strides towards a more sustainable future.

<h3 align="center">📚✏️ Sample Curriculum 📊🎓</h4>

------
Throughout my extensive experience as a Computer Science Instructor, I've been dedicated to developing comprehensive technical curriculum in various roles. Although I can't share proprietary information, I'm eager to showcase a sample of my work, particularly highlighting a collection of mini-lessons I made using Google Slides and Pear Deck.

* [Linked Lists](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XpfXXrCHUQhT8n7LhkB-TPOSynedIpESBQUl4mh0mac/edit?usp=sharing) (***Target Audience:** College students*)<br>
  A mini-lesson on Linked Lists I put together, showcasing my custom illustrative graphics modeling the concept. The lesson involves engaging coding challenges and a live student interaction demo, aiming to foster active participation and a clear grasp of this foundational data structure.
* [Variables + Conditionals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZ8tLKpxPuPRRwBVwvY6whiT41QKCUtV1IswBCdR_Xg/edit#slide=id.g1034e2318fa_1_400) (***Target Audience:** Freshman in high school*)<Br> A mini-lesson I created to simplify concepts of programming languages, Python, variables, and conditional statements, demonstrated through a fun Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
